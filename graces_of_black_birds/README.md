_Graces of Black Birds_ is a virtual darkwave band hailing from Detroit. The currently have an album and an EP on Bandcamp and a handful of videos on Currently, plans are in the works for two concept album, a website, and a book along with active social media accounts for each member of the band.

The idea of _Graces of Black Birds_ began while experimenting with AI audio generation, specificly Udio. Growing up listening to music, I always found that the stories behind the artists and their song added depth and meaning to the music. So after creating the song _Truly Mine_, I created the band (with the assistance of AI) along with its backstory and the backstories of its members.
