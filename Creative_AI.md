# A Creative's Understanding of AI
## Introduction

## The Human Brain
- Made of ~100 billion neurons
- 

## The "Computer Brain" (neural networks)
- While neural networks are not the only structure used in AI/Machine Learning (ML), they are possibly the most ubiqitous and most recognized.
- Based (roughly) on the brain.
- A "neuron" is a mathimatical function that 
  - takes an input (usually a floating point number),
  - applies weights and balances to that input,
  - applies the function to that,
  - then send the output to the next layer of neurons
- Typically less than a thousand neurons (0.001% of the human brain).
